### Hey!

I'm Sam, an software engineer with a passion for systems programming, distributed systems, and high-perfomance services.

I'm from the UK and recently graduated with a BSC Computer Science.

I'm competent in:
- Rust
- Go
- Javascript
- Python
- Java
- Web *(HTML+CSS+DOM+WASM)*

I have my own Gitlab, and hence don't use Github very often anymore.
