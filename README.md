### Hey!

I'm Sam, an aspiring full stack developer, focusing on web-development and backend-functionally.

I'm from the UK and currently taking A-Level Computer Science and Further Mathematics.

I'm competent in:
- Rust
- Go
- Javascript
- Python
- Java
- Web *(HTML+CSS+DOM)*

I have my own Gitlab, and hence don't use Github very often anymore.
